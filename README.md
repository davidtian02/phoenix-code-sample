===================

The code in this repository is for a space shooter game that I created. Many components (such as the framework) have been ripped out, and the code here is only for the purposes of viewing (as opposed to running on an actual device). The video for what this code does is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aqg-LeW-ylQ.  

This was a project in early 2013, with the coding portion taking about a month to two months worth of time. It's far from perfect in terms of design, and there are several areas of code duplication...etc. but should give an idea of one way to to code up a space shooter game with MOBA-style elements.
